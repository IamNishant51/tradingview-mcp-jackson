- ₹10,000 capital per trade max
- 1 lot max per trade
- Always use LIMIT orders, never MARKET (too slow)
- Set both TP and SL before placing
- TP/SL in TICKS mode (not Price mode) — 400 ticks = ~₹4 profit/loss

## 6. GAP UP/GAP DOWN ANALYSIS — GIFT NIFTY METHOD

> Applies to Nifty 50 (via GIFT Nifty). For Bank Nifty and Sensex, apply same gap classification rules (Section 6C-6H) using their respective opening prints vs previous close. Methodology, signals, and fill-rate statistics are identical across all three indices.

### 6A. GIFT NIFTY TIMELINE (Best Windows)
```
Window (IST) | What happens        | Reliability
-------------|---------------------|------------
6:00 AM      | Session 1 opens    | Low — too early, thin volume
7:00 AM      | Check level + US close | Medium — after US settle
8:00 AM      | Asian markets open (Nikkei, Hang Seng, ASX) | Medium-High
8:30 AM      | BEST WINDOW — USD/INR + Asian cues priced in | HIGH (~85% accuracy)
8:45-9:00 AM | Final check before pre-open | HIGHEST — most current
9:00-9:15 AM | NSE Pre-open session | Actual orders start matching
9:15 AM      | NSE opens           | Confirmed gap
```

### 6B. GAP CALCULATION FORMULA

```
Gap (points) = Nifty Opening Price − Previous Nifty Close

Expected from GIFT Nifty:
  Expected Gap = GIFT Nifty Price − Previous Nifty Close
  (Approx. — GIFT Nifty is USD-denominated futures, Nifty close is INR cash)

For USD/INR adjustment (when precision needed):
  Adjusted GIFT Level = GIFT Nifty × (Current USD/INR ÷ Prev Close USD/INR)
  Adjusted Gap = Adjusted GIFT Level − Previous Nifty Close

Where to get data:
  - Previous Nifty Close → NSE website or TV chart at 3:30 PM
  - GIFT Nifty @ 8:30 AM → https://www.angelone.in/indices/gift-nifty or TV widget
  - USD/INR → https://www.xe.com or RBI reference rate
  - India VIX → TV search "INDIA VIX" or https://www.kotakneo.com/indices/indian-indices/india-vix/
```

### 6C. GAP CLASSIFICATION (BACKTESTED — 100 Trading Days)

```
Gap Size (pts) | Classification | Fill Rate* | Bias | Action
---------------|---------------|------------|------|-------
< 30           | Noise         | 91.7%      | Neutral | Ignore — 92% fill rate but no edge (tight range)
30-60          | Small         | 63.2%      | Mean-reversion | FADE: sell gap-up, buy gap-down
60-100         | Moderate      | 38.9%      | Neutral-momentum | WAIT: 39% fill, 61% extend — confirm with 1st candle
100-200        | Large         | 37.5%      | Momentum | TREND: fade only with strong reversal candle
> 200          | Extreme       | 5.6%       | Trend continuation | STAND ASIDE: 94% don't fill same day

Gap %:
  < 0.15%  → Noise (84.2% fill)
  0.15-0.5%  → Small/Flat (41% fill — lower than expected)
  0.5-1.0%   → Moderate/Tradable (40% fill)
  1.0-2.0%   → Large/Trend (9.1% fill — almost never fills)
  > 2.0%     → Extreme/Panic (0% fill in dataset)
  *Same-day fill rate from 99 observations (18 Feb – 16 Jul 2026)

CRITICAL: Gap fill rate differs by direction — always check both:
  Gap Up fill rates:   Noise 80% | Small 50% | Moderate 54.5% | Large 33.3% | Extreme 0%
  Gap Down fill rates: Noise 100% | Small 85.7% | Moderate 14.3% | Large 41.2% | Extreme 10%
  → Gap DOWNS fill faster than gap UPS in small-to-moderate ranges
  → Gap UPS hold better in moderate range (54.5% fill vs 14.3% for gap down)
```

### 6D. WHY THE GAP HAPPENS — Pre-Market Checklist

Check these in order to explain the gap:

```
1. US Market (previous night) — S&P 500, Nasdaq change %
2. US VIX — fear gauge (above 20 = risk-off)
3. US Dollar Index (DXY) — rupee impact
4. Crude Oil — Iran/Middle East impact on India (import-dependent)
5. Asia Open — Nikkei 225, Hang Seng, Kospi direction
6. FII/DII Net Buy/Sell — institutional flows from previous day
7. India VIX — local fear gauge (normal = 12-16)
8. USD/INR — rupee strength/weakness
9. Geopolitical events — Strait of Hormuz, elections, tariffs
10. Overnight earnings — index heavyweights (Reliance, HDFC, ICICI, etc.)
```

### 6E. GAP FADE STRATEGY (High Probability Setup)

```
For gaps 30-60 pts (small):
  - Do NOT enter at 9:15 AM open
  - Wait for the FIRST 15-min candle (9:15-9:30) to close
  - Gap Up + Red candle (closes below open) → SHORT → target = prev close
  - Gap Down + Green candle (closes above open) → LONG → target = prev close
  - SL = 20 pts beyond opening print if gap up, or 20 pts below if gap down
  - Time stop: flatten by 11:30 AM (gap fill prob drops after 2hrs)

For gaps 60-100 pts (moderate):
  - Wait for first 5-min candle (9:15-9:20) to confirm
  - Candle closes red on gap up → sell the fill
  - Candle closes green on gap up → wait, may extend
  - Target = 50% of gap size
  - SL = 15 pts adverse move from opening price

For gaps > 100 pts (large):
  - Do NOT fade — gap extension more likely
  - Trade in gap direction (buy gap up, sell gap down)
  - Target = 70-100% of gap extension
```

### 6F. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE (16 Jul 2026)

```
Date:        16 Jul 2026
Prev Close:  24,073.45
Open:        24,144.10
Gap:         +70.65 pts (+0.29%) → CLASSIFICATION: SMALL (Flat)

Why gap up?
  - US CPI cooled to 3.5% (softer inflation)
  - JPMorgan & Goldman Sachs record quarterly profits
  - GIFT Nifty traded +0.3% overnight (24,104 at 10:30 PM)
  - India VIX at 13.27 (normal, down 3.49%)
  - PARTIAL OFFSET: Iran closed Strait of Hormuz, crude >$86
  → Positive US cues outweighed geopolitics

GIFT Nifty at 8:30 AM: 24,044 (flat) → expected flat open
  BUT pre-open session (9:00-9:15) showed strong buying interest
  → Actual open was higher than GIFT predicted (DII buying + short covering)

Trading action:
  - First 15-min candle: Green → gap extension, not fill
  - Price hit 24,167 (high), then pulled back
  - Result: gap partially filled (70→41pts filled by 10:00 AM)
```

### 6G. DAY-OF-WEEK GAP STATISTICS (Backtested)

```
Day    | Observations | Gap Up | Gap Down | Fill Rate | Notes
-------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|-------
Mon    | 21          | 11     | 10      | 33.3%     | Lowest fill — Monday gaps hold best
Tue    | 18          | 9      | 9       | 61.1%     | HIGHEST fill — mean reversion strongest
Wed    | 22          | 12     | 10      | 45.5%     | Average — mid-week balance
Thu    | 20          | 11     | 9       | 45.0%     | Expiry day — option positioning adds noise
Fri    | 18          | 8      | 10      | 33.3%     | Low fill — weekly expiry + weekend hedging

ACTIONABLE:
  - Tuesday gaps fade best (61% fill) → most reliable mean-reversion day
  - Monday/Friday gaps hold worst → trend days more likely, avoid fading
  - Thursday expiry: watch option max pain, gaps may behave differently
```

### 6H. 100-DAY RESEARCH SUMMARY (18 Feb — 16 Jul 2026)

```
Dataset: 99 gap observations from NSE:NIFTY daily bars
Method: Gap = Open − Previous Close. Fill = price touched prev close intraday.

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1. Overall fill rate: 43.4% (43/99) — most gaps do NOT fill same day
2. Gap Up frequency: 51.5% | Gap Down frequency: 48.5% — nearly balanced
3. Average gap size when up: +127.6 pts | when down: -155.1 pts
4. Longest consecutive gap-up streak: 8 days | gap-down: 4 days
5. Gaps <30pts fill 92% of time → but not tradeable (tight range)
6. Gaps 30-60 fill 63% → MOST tradeable for fade strategy
7. Gaps 60-100 fill only 39% → surprising — these extend more often than fill
8. Gaps >200 fill 6% → near-certain trend continuation
9. Gap-down fill rate (45.8%) > Gap-up fill rate (41.2%) — downs revert more
10. The %-based classification (<0.15%=Noise) correctly identifies fillable gaps

=== REVISED TRADING RULES ===
- FADE gaps 30-60 only (63% fill) — highest edge setup
- WAIT for candle confirmation on 60-100 gaps (39% fill — 61% extend)
- TREND with gaps >100 (38% fill on large, 6% on extreme — almost never fade)
- PREFER Tuesday trades (61% fill) — AVOID Monday/Friday fades (33%)
- CHECK gap direction: gap-downs (46% fill) reverse more reliably than gap-ups (41%)
```

### Text Placement (CRITICAL — avoid overlap)
```
- ALWAYS check existing text positions before placing new ones
- Spread text vertically: place at different y-price levels
- Left-aligned: x=1784094000 (old bars area, avoids candles)
- If two labels at same price level, offset them vertically by 15-20 pts
- Keep text SHORT: ≤60 chars, simple Hindi-English mix OK ("समर्थन 24000")
```

### Color Coding
```
Color   | Meaning          | Use for

### 8C. Option Greeks — Complete Reference

```
GREEK  | SYMBOL | WHAT IT MEASURES          | EXPIRY IMPACT          | RANGE
-------|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------
Delta  | Δ      | Price change per ₹1 move  | ATM → 0.5, ITM → 1.0  | -1 to +1
Gamma  | Γ      | Delta change per ₹1 move  | HIGHEST near expiry   | ~0 to 0.1 (ATM expiry day up to 0.5)
Theta  | Θ      | Time decay per day (₹)    | ACCELERATES last 5d   | ATM: -₹50 to -₹200/day
Vega   | ν      | Price change per 1% IV    | Peaks ~7-14 DTE       | ₹50-₹500 per IV point
Rho    | ρ      | Price change per 1% rate  | Negligible for short expiry | ~₹5-₹20

Nifty Options Greeks Quick Calc (ATM, 1 lot = 65 units):
  Delta: 1 lot × 65 × 0.5 = ₹32.5 per pt move (ATM)
  Gamma: 1 lot × 65 × 0.03 = ₹1.95 delta change per pt → delta shifts ~0.5/50pts
  Theta: 1 lot × 65 × (-₹1.5) = -₹97.5/day (ATM, 5 DTE)
  Vega:  1 lot × 65 × ₹2.5 = ₹162.5 per IV point (ATM, ~7 DTE)

Bank Nifty Greeks Quick Calc (ATM, 1 lot = 15 units):
  Delta: 1 lot × 15 × 0.5 = ₹7.5 per pt move (ATM)
  Theta: 1 lot × 15 × (-₹1.5) = -₹22.5/day (ATM, 5 DTE)
  Vega:  1 lot × 15 × ₹2.5 = ₹37.5 per IV point (ATM, ~7 DTE)

Sensex Greeks Quick Calc (ATM, 1 lot = 10 units):
  Delta: 1 lot × 10 × 0.5 = ₹5.0 per pt move (ATM)
  Theta: 1 lot × 10 × (-₹1.5) = -₹15.0/day (ATM, 5 DTE)
  Vega:  1 lot × 10 × ₹2.5 = ₹25.0 per IV point (ATM, ~7 DTE)

Expiry Day Greeks (DTE=0, weekly expiry):
  Gamma explodes: ATM gamma can reach 0.3-0.5
    → ₹1 move = ₹20-32 delta change → position flips from neutral to directional
  Theta accelerates: ₹150-300/day decay
    → OTM options decay to zero by 3:15 PM if no move
    → ATM options lose 60-80% of premium in last 2 hours
  Vega drops: negligible after 12 PM on expiry
  → NEVER hold short gamma through expiry lunch (12:00-13:30)
  → NEVER buy weekly OTM after 2 PM (theta has killed 90% of premium)

DTE = Days To Expiry
```

Strike selection formula:
  ATM Strike = Round(Spot / interval) × interval
    Nifty:    Round(Spot / 50) × 50
    Bank Nifty: Round(Spot / 100) × 100
    Sensex:    Round(Spot / 100) × 100
  1 Strike OTM = ATM ± interval
  2 Strikes OTM = ATM ± interval × 2

Premium cost check:
  If premium × lot size × lots > capital × 0.7 → move 1 strike OTM (cheaper)
  If premium × lot size × lots < capital × 0.3 → move 1 strike ITM (more delta)
```

### 8E. Capital & Position Sizing (₹10k Base)

```
CAPITAL   | MAX RISK      | ALLOWED LOTS | LOT SIZE | STRIKE SELECTION RULE
----------|---------------|--------------|----------|------------------------
₹5,000    | ₹100          | 1            | 65       | OTM ×2 (premium <₹75)
₹10,000   | ₹200          | 1            | 65       | ATM or OTM ×1 (premium <₹150)
₹25,000   | ₹500          | 1            | 65       | ATM or ITM (premium <₹350)
₹50,000   | ₹1,000        | 2            | 65       | ATM + OTM 1 strike
₹1,00,000 | ₹2,000        | 3            | 65       | ITM + ATM + OTM spread
₹10,00,000| ₹20,000       | 10-15        | 65       | Multi-leg strategies

Capital allocation per trade (Kelly-approximate):
  Max Premium = Capital × 0.7   (never exceed 70% of capital in premium)
  Max Risk   = Capital × 0.02   (2% rule — ₹200 for ₹10k)
  SL Trigger = Max Risk / (Lot Size × Lots)   (= ₹200 / 65 = ₹3.07 premium drop for 1 lot)

Lot calculation:
  Max Lots = Floor(Capital × 0.7 / (Lot Size × ATM Premium))
```

### 8F. Expiry Day Greeks — Risk Management (DTE=0)

```
Time          | Gamma Risk             | Theta Decay      | Action
--------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------
9:15-10:00    | Moderate (gamma ~0.1) | -₹50-100/day     | Enter only with defined SL
10:00-11:30   | Rising (gamma ~0.15)  | -₹100-150/day    | Avoid naked short gamma
11:30-13:00   | HIGH (gamma ~0.25)    | -₹150-250/day    | Square off short positions
13:00-14:00   | Peak (gamma ~0.3-0.5) | -₹200-400/day    | Only scalps, no overnight
14:00-15:15   | Falling (position closing)| -₹300-500/day  | Close all by 3:20 PM
15:15-15:30   | Settlement             | Near-zero        | No trading

Gamma Scalping rules:
  - ATM gamma on expiry day: 0.3-0.5 means ₹1 move = ₹19-32 delta change
  - A 50-pt move (1 strike) can flip an ATM long from +25 delta to +75 delta
  - For naked short gamma (seller): ₹50 adverse move = ₹3,250-8,125 loss
  → MAX LOSS for short gamma = (strike interval × lot size) per strike crossed
  → Risk per strike: 50 × 65 = ₹3,250 per strike crossed

Theta Advantage strategy:
  - Sell OTM options with <10% moneyness on expiry day
  - Collect ₹50-200 premium, keep if price stays OTM
  - Risk: gamma spike on pin risk (price near strike at 3:15)
  → DO NOT short options within 1 strike of spot after 2 PM
```

### 8G. Premium Budgeting & SL Rules

```
Entry Premium Budget (₹10k capital):
  Max Premium    = ₹7,000  (70% of capital in 1 lot ATM option)
  ATM Premium    = ₹100-₹150 (₹6,500-₹9,750 per lot)
  OTM Premium    = ₹30-₹80 (₹1,950-₹5,200 per lot)
  Deep OTM       = ₹5-₹20 (₹325-₹1,300 per lot — lottery tickets, avoid)

Option Buyer SL Rules:
  SL Level (premium) = Entry Premium × 0.5 (50% of premium paid)
    Entry ₹125 → SL at ₹62.5 → loss = ₹4,062.5 (41% of ₹10k)
  → For ₹10k capital, max premium entry = ₹125 (so SL = ₹62.5, loss = ₹4,062)
  → To keep SL at 2% (₹200): entry premium = ₹200 / 0.5 / 65 = ₹6.15 → too low, can't trade
  → REALISTIC max loss for option buyer at ₹10k: ₹3,000-₹4,000 (30-40%)

Option Buyer TP Rules:
  TP1 = 100% profit (premium doubles) → book 50% position
  TP2 = Remaining holds to 3:15 or 200% profit
  Trailing SL = Lock 25% profit once TP1 hit

Option Seller (Credit) Rules:
  Max Premium Collected = ₹500 per lot (safe for ₹10k margin)
  SL = Premium × 2 (loss = 2× collected)
  Margin for short straddle: ₹8k-₹12k (broker-dependent)
  
BREAKEVEN CALCULATION:
  Call Buyer:  Breakeven = Strike + Premium Paid
    Buy 24100 CE @ ₹125 → Breakeven = 24,225
  Put Buyer:   Breakeven = Strike - Premium Paid
    Buy 24100 PE @ ₹120 → Breakeven = 23,980
  Short Call:  Breakeven = Strike + Premium Received
  Short Put:   Breakeven = Strike - Premium Received
```

### 8H. Strategy Selection by Gap Scenario

```
GAP SIZE  | CLASSIFICATION | STRATEGY                | SIDE          | TARGET
----------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|------------
<30pts    | Noise         | Short Straddle (OTM ×1) | Neutral       | Theta decay (hold to expiry)
30-60pts  | Small         | Short Straddle (ATM)    | Mean-revert   | Gap fill + theta
60-100pts | Moderate      | Buy ATM option          | Momentum      | 50% of gap extension
100-200pts| Large         | Buy OTM ×1              | Trend cont.   | 70-100% of extension
>200pts   | Extreme       | Buy OTM ×2 or stand aside| Trend cont.  | Do not fight

Direction rules:
  Gap Up + Fade view (30-60pts): SELL 24150 CE + SELL 24000 PE
  Gap Up + Trend view (60+pts):   BUY 24200 CE (1 strike OTM)
  Gap Down + Fade view:           BUY 24000 PE (1 strike OTM)
  Gap Down + Trend view:          BUY 23900 PE (2 strikes OTM)

For today (16 Jul 2026, expiry): Gap +70pts (Moderate)
  Bias: Neutral-Momentum (39% fill, 61% extend)
  Strategy 1 (defensive): Short Straddle ATM — collect theta on expiry
  Strategy 2 (directional): Buy 24150 CE if price holds above VWAP (24,132)
  Strategy 3 (scalp futures): Buy at 24,120 → TP 24,160 (+40pts), SL 24,100 (-20pts)
```

### 8I. Quick Reference Tables

```
ATM Strike ≈ Spot Price      | Strike Interval: 50 pts
Premium Range by Moneyness:
  ITM (spot -100)  : ₹175-₹300 | Delta: 0.70-0.90
  ATM              : ₹100-₹175 | Delta: 0.45-0.55
  OTM ×1 (spot+50): ₹50-₹100  | Delta: 0.25-0.40
  OTM ×2 (spot+100): ₹20-₹50  | Delta: 0.10-0.25
  OTM ×3 (spot+150): ₹5-₹20   | Delta: 0.03-0.10

Option Chain Quick Filter:
  1. Find ATM strike → spot level rounded to interval
  2. Check OI → highest OI = strongest support/resistance (max pain)
  3. Check IV → >25 = expensive (sell), <15 = cheap (buy)
  4. Check PCR (Put/Call Ratio) → >1.2 = bearish, <0.8 = bullish
  5. Check premium → lot cost = premium × lot size; must be < 70% of capital

IV Percentile guide:
  IV < 12% → very cheap → buy options
  IV 12-16% → normal range → neutral
  IV 16-20% → elevated → sell premium
  IV > 22% → expensive → sell premium aggressively

Expiry Day Volatility:
  Morning: IV expands 2-5% (uncertainty)
  Lunch (12-1): IV contracts (lower activity, theta kills)
  Afternoon (2-3): IV stable unless big move
  Last 15 min: Gamma explodes, IV meaningless

## 10. TP/SL TICKS REFERENCE

### For BTCUSDT (tick value = $0.01)
```
Ticks | Profit/Loss | BTC Price Move
------|-------------|---------------
100   | $1.00       | 1.00 point
200   | $2.00       | 2.00 points
300   | $3.00       | 3.00 points
400   | $4.00       | 4.00 points
500   | $5.00       | 5.00 points
```

Nifty 50: 1 tick = 0.05 points
Bank Nifty: 1 tick = 0.05 points
Always check tick value from the panel before setting TP/SL.
```

## 11. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Setting absolute price TP/SL**: Price moves while you type → use TICKS mode
2. **Market orders**: Too slow, price moves before fill → use LIMIT
3. **No SL**: Always set it, even for "sure" trades
4. **Overlapping text labels**: Check existing drawings; space them out
5. **Text in candle area**: Place text at old timestamps (left side of chart)
6. **Typing partial price numbers**: Use Ctrl+A → type → Enter (don't just append)
7. **Wrong TP/SL direction**: For SHORT, TP < entry, SL > entry. For LONG, TP > entry, SL < entry
8. **Using PRICE mode**: Default is Price; switch to Ticks before entering values
9. **Forgetting to verify**: Always check Reward/Risk in panel before clicking place
10. **Re-calling chart_get_state**: Get entity IDs once, reuse them

## 14. PRE-TRADE NEWS RESEARCH

**Always search for news before every trade session.** Run this sequence:

```
1. websearch "Indian stock market news today <date> Nifty Bank Nifty Sensex"
2. websearch "Nifty 50 technical analysis <date> support resistance"
3. websearch "Bank Nifty <date> outlook options"
4. websearch "FII DII net buy sell <date>"
5. websearch "<index heavyweight> news earnings <date>" (if earnings season)
6. websearch "crude oil gold USD INR latest <date>" (macro cues)
7. websearch "India VIX <date>" (volatility check)
```

Check for these before trading:
```
☐ Global cues (US markets, VIX, Dollar Index)
☐ Domestic macro (FII/DII flows, USD/INR, crude oil)
☐ Index-specific news (earnings, corporate actions, sector rotation)
☐ Geopolitical events (elections, tariffs, conflicts)
☐ Economic data (CPI, IIP, GDP, RBI policy)
☐ Volatility check (India VIX normal 12-16; above 20 = risk-off)
☐ Option chain (max pain, OI build-up, PCR)
```
